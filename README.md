# Creating a form with HTML5 and CSS

For creating a form, we are going to need HTML5 inputs and CSS for styling it up a bit.

## Types of input

An input type is selected with the input attribute called `type`. There are many types of inputs e.g

For text type:
```
<input type="text" name="name" required>
```
The `required` attribute has been used to handle errors incase the user submits the form while the inout field is empty.

For email type:
```
<input type="email" name="email" required>
```

For number type:
```
<input type="number" name="number" required>
```

For radio type:
```
<input type="radio" name="radio" required>
```

For checkbox type:
```
<input type="checkbox" name="checkbox" required>
```
